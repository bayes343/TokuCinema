                                        "1962-1964: Toho began making dubs of their films available, which were advertised through their English language Toho Films catalog. Most special effects films released between 1958 and 1962 were included in the selections, with the notable exception of the Columbia titles and Gorath. Dubs aren’t normally listed for films released the year of the catalog, hence why all the dubs known of 1963 films aren’t advertised in the ‘63 catalog, including Samurai Pirate, Atragon, Matango, and Attack Squadron (Secret of the Telegian, dated 1963 on the international ending title, also isn’t listed in the ‘63 catalog). The few complete dubs and dubbed trailers from this era that are available present a mix of both Tokyo and Hong Kong voicework. It isn’t completely clear how different dubbing groups/centers were chosen for each dub, but it has been noticed that all complete Toho export dubs and export trailers produced through mid 1963 feature Tokyo dubbing talent, and that the known dubbing cast members of a few unavailable dubs from this period were also from Tokyo dubbing talent. All available Toho export dubs produced between mid or late 1963 and mid or late 1966 are Hong Kong dubs. All available Toho export dubs dating to between late 1966 or early 1967 and late 1969 are Tokyo dubs. This could also just be selection bias because we don’t have a huge sample of dubs from this period quite yet, but this pattern could point to the hypothetical dub being produced in Hong Kong, like the one for Gargantuas.",
                                        "1966-1970: English Toho posters, lobby cards, and other print advertising materials for the film began to be issued, all consistently featuring a stylized \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\" logo. The posters feature a unique illustration while the lobby cards were adapted from the original Japanese lobby cards. The title cards in Toho's international versions (before the 1990’s) tended to be based on title logos appearing on posters and other paper materials, which is not the case with the current international copy. For this film, the title that has been used on and mentioned in paper materials for 50 years isn't even the same title, Toho has opted to use \"Invasion of the Astro-Monsters\" in their current international dub. These materials can be dated to before 1970 due to the crediting of Toho Company, Ltd. and the inclusion of the terms Eastmancolor and Tohoscope (while from 1970 and onward, Toho English advertising credits Toho International Co., Ltd. and instead includes the terms color and widescreen). Another thing constraining the Toho English materials’ creation to 1966 to 1970 is the fact that many non-American, foreign releases from those years utilize the international poster art and adaptations of the international logo in the releasing country’s language. For example, the February 1967 German release is the first known release to feature heavy adaptation of the English Toho materials in its posters and other materials.",

This Turkish trailer is assumed to be based on an international trailer. The English text in the trailer utilizes typefaces seen in Toho advertising material used for some of their other 1960's films and a typeface similar to the one used in Saperstein’s American version of Astro-Monster. This trailer is not adequate proof that a complete international dub was created, since it was not uncommon for Toho to commission a dubbed trailer for a movie and nothing else. For example, an international trailer for Gorath is known to exist, but there is no evidence that a complete dub was created.",

Also cut is Titanosaurus stomping on the two schoolboys, which this version makes it look as if Godzilla saves them. These edits are choppy, resulting in jumps in Ifukube's score.

                                        "Like Godzilla King of the Monsters, additional American shot footage is added with a now grey Raymond Burr. While the first few scenes are effective, much of this footage is more comedic than serious and the scenes with Burr at the military base feature heavy product placement for the soft drink Dr. Pepper.",
                                        "While a good amount of Reijiro Koroku's score was kept, some music from Christopher Young (originally from the movie Def Con 4) was added and there are other sound design changes as well.",
                                        "Shortened scenes include: Goro's fight with the sea louse, the scenes where Goro tells Naoko that Hiroshi is still alive and when the two are reunite; as well as the meeting between the Prime Minister, the American ambassador, and the Russian ambassador is heavily shortened and moved to take place prior to Godzilla’s attack on the nuclear power plant.",
                                        "The opening credits, while containing the same Koroku music, are completely different to the credits in the Japanese version which appear over the eruption on Daikoku Island which awakens Godzilla. Other modified scenes include: Godzilla's attack on Tokyo is somewhat rearranged and he's made to look more aggressive in some scenes, the credits were altered and the song \"Godzilla\" by the Star Sisters was not used, instead opting for a medley of Koroku's themes and the added Christopher Young music was used over a black screen. Interesting enough, another love theme called \"I Was Afraid to Love You\" was written for the film but went unused for some reason.",
                                        "Godzilla 1985's most severe change is that it demonizes the Russians and turns them into villains. To achieve this, a shot of a U.S. missile satellite is cut and the Russian freighter captain explains that the Russian government has decided to use nuclear weapons. The most controversial of all the modified scenes is one where the captain sacrifices his life trying stop the missile from being launched, which is changed to him actually launching this missile added footage of a hand pressing a button. These scenes included altered subtitles to achieve the effect of demonizing the Russians.",
                                        "At the end of this version of the movie, Godzilla screams as he falls into Mt. Mihara. This scream is not present in most other versions of the movie. While it was previously thought that this scream was one of the many sound design tweaks exclusive to this version, it was actually just sourced from the \"B\" mix music and effects track, which can also be heard in the 1985 Drama LP and early versions of the international dub.",
                                        "Around 30 minutes of footage is removed from the Japanese version, which makes some pacing improvement, but also loses a lot of poignant moments. Scenes cut include: a scene where Goro calls his editor to discuss his story which the editor is skeptical about, a scene where Hayashida shows Hiroshi pictures of the 1954 Godzilla, a scene where Naoko tells Goro that she's disappointed with him because of his article, a scene where the Prime Minister speaks to his cabinet about the prospect of using nuclear weapons against Godzilla, a scene where the Prime Minister tells his aide that he convinced the U.S. and Russia to back off from using nuclear weapons by getting them to empathize with Japan's position, a scene where a crowd is warned to stay back by police after Godzilla is brought down by the Super-X, and a romantic scene between Goro and Naoko."

The Toho logo and Toho Eiga title replaced by \"TriStar Pictures Presents\" and \"A Toho Co., Ltd. Presentation of a Toho Pictures Inc. Production\", respectively. The Japanese title card is present, but the film's title is subtitled in English under it, via video-generated subtitles. The opening credits before the title card are textless, but has credits after the opening title. The rest of film is uncut, except for the end credits, which begin with scrolling copyright information and then the film fades out."

However, since all of AI-TV’s other Gamera movies aired on television roughly one year after their Japanese release, it is possible that Destroy All Planets aired as early as 1969.",

The second and third Gyaos battles have been edited into the sequence before the first battle to avoid making a new transition to end the montage.

This footage, which like the Oodako alternate endping sequence, was filmed at Saperstein's insistence, shows a more aggressive Frankenstein and includes some coverage of police officers being crushed by rubble as Frankenstien breaks out of captivity. A slightly later sequence shows Frankenstein bending a lamppost and throwing it at a police cruiser and then grabbing the cruiser and throwing it, causing it to explode. There is a stutter in Ifukube's music during the sequence.",

Honda and Tsuburaya filmed and finished the sequence. However, for whatever reason, Saperstein changed his mind and the scene was discarded and used in neither the Japanese or US edits, though musical cues from the sequence can be heard as Frankenstein sinks into the ground in the U.S. edit. The alternate ending finally reappeared in the 1980s as an extra on Toho's VHS and LaserDisc and was available on Media Blasters' region 1 DVD."

The dance sequence with Kaoru Yumi is also cut. A few lines in two scenes from the film are actually redubbed as the English track has the female narrator (Kyoko Kishida in the Japanese version) reciting a prophecy over it and the other for no apparent reason.",
